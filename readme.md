# 1Password to Pass Unix Password Manager

## Introduction

This is a shell script that converts a .csv generated by 1Password 8 file into password entries in the [pass password manager](https://www.passwordstore.org/). The script requires the pass CLI tool to be installed.

## Supported file types

The script only supports .csv files yet.

## Usage

To use the script, run the following command:

```bash
./script.sh <filename>.csv
```

## Limitations

The script does not support multi-line notes in the csv file. It is recommended to remove and save them before using the script.

## Output

The script outputs a confirmation message for each successful password entry added to the password manager. Invalid csv rows are skipped with an error message. An unsupported file type will result in an error message.
